Examinations of your newborn baby
Undersökningar av det nyfödda barnet - engelska

A newborn baby is examined in a number of different ways during its first few days of life. Most of the examinations are done in hospital before you go home. You may need to come back for examinations if you have gone home early.

The timing of some of the examinations may vary. It depends, for example, on how you and your baby are doing.

Immediately after birth

Your baby will be examined several times immediately after birth.

Among other things, the staff will listen to your baby’s heartbeat and their breathing.

Your baby will receive treatment if necessary.

The baby can usually be held by a parent during this time. Sometimes the baby will need to be examined on a special table.
A midwife will examine your baby

A midwife will examine your baby a few hours after birth. The examination will include the following:

    The baby will be weighed and measured.
    The baby’s body temperature will be measured.
    A special substance in the blood will be measured. The midwife measures this using a meter on the skin. Sometimes a blood test is needed. If the value is high, the baby may need treatment.
    The baby will be given a shot of vitamin K in their thigh.

Sometimes blood sugar is measured.
A paediatrician will examine your baby

All babies are examined by a paediatrician before they go home. The examination is quick.

The paediatrician looks at and listens to the following:

    the heart
    the lungs and breathing
    the stomach
    the eyes
    the head
    the genitals and rectum
    the skin.

If you gave birth at home

A paediatrician should examine your baby as soon as possible after birth.

Talk to a midwife before the birth to plan an appointment.
PKU test

After two days, a blood test called a PKU test is performed. A blood sample for the test is taken from a blood vessel in the baby’s hand or foot.

The test is performed to check whether the baby has any unusual diseases.

It is good for the baby to have nursed shortly before the sample is taken, because the baby will then be calm and it will hurt less. Sometimes the baby may have sugar water in their mouth while the sample is taken.
Examination of your baby’s hearing

During the POX screening, a device is connected to your baby’s hand or foot. It is held in place with a clip or adhesive tape.

The examination is done to check whether your baby has a congenital heart defect.

It is quick and painless.
Your baby’s first pee and poo

The hospital staff will check whether your baby has peed and pooped before you go home.

Here you can see pictures of how a baby’s pee and poo change colour in the first week. The text is in Swedish.
The children’s health centre takes over

After you have come home from hospital, you will have your first contact with the children’s health centre (BVC). A BVC nurse will then make a home visit.
Get help from an interpreter

You may be entitled to an interpreter if you do not speak Swedish.

Breastfeeding
Amning - engelska

Breastfeeding gives your baby food, closeness and security. But it can take time to get breastfeeding to work smoothly. Help is available.

How to get a good breastfeeding attachment

Läs texten på svenska här.
Breast milk can protect against disease

Breast milk protects your baby against certain diseases.
Breastfeeding can also reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
Baby formula can be a substitute for breast milk

Some people cannot or do not want to breastfeed. In such case, the baby can be given baby formula.

This is made to resemble breast milk as closely as possible.
Until what age should a baby breastfeed?

For the first six months, your baby should be given only breast milk or formula.

After six months, you can start giving your baby small amounts of food. Continue feeding them with breast milk or formula in parallel to this until your baby is at least one year old.
Starting to nurse a newborn baby

When your baby is a newborn, it is a good idea to hold them skin-to-skin.

Your baby may start to search for the breast on their own. Some babies may need a little help.

The first milk that comes is called colostrum. It is especially rich in nutrients.
It may take time to get started breastfeeding

It can sometimes take a few days for breastfeeding to get started. It may also take some time for the baby to learn to suckle in a way that works well.
The baby needs to latch on well

The baby needs to open their mouth wide and latch on to both the nipple and areola. The areola is the area around the nipple. This allows the baby to get enough milk. It also reduces the risk of you developing problems when breastfeeding.

How to tell when your baby has latched on well:

    Your baby needs to have as much of the areola as possible in their mouth.
    Your nipple looks the same after your baby has suckled.
    Your baby's lips are spread wide.

You may need to hand-express milk

If you are having trouble getting started with breastfeeding, you may need to hand-express milk or use a breast pump. Your baby may also need baby formula.
The staff at the BB ward (maternity ward) can show you how to hand-express milk or use a breast pump.
You can give your baby breast milk or formula with a spoon, cup or mug.
How do I know if my baby is getting enough?

Most babies show when they are satisfied and do not want any more.

Here is how you can tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk:

    Your baby is alert.
    Your baby wakes up on their own and wants to suckle the breast.
    Your baby seems happy after nursing.
    Your baby gains weight. Your baby's weight will be checked at the children's health centre (BVC).
    Your baby pees so much that you have to change their nappy at least six times a day.
    Your baby's poo changes colour from black to yellow during the first week.

Advice and support

It may take some time to get started with breastfeeding and make it work smoothly. When this happens, it is good to have support, both from loved ones and healthcare professionals.

In the first week after the baby is born, you can contact BB.
After this, you can contact one of the following clinics:

    BVC
    a midwifery clinic (barnmorskemottagning)
    a lactation support clinic, if one is available where you live.

Get help from an interpreter

You can get help from an interpreter if you do not speak Swedish.
Call 1177 for advice

Call the 1177 helpline if you need advice on what to do. Your call will be answered by a nurse. The nurse can speak both Swedish and English. Help is sometimes available in other languages. Call +46 771 11 77 00 if you are calling from a phone with a foreign number.

Common breastfeeding problems
Vanliga besvär vid amning - engelska

It is common to experience breast discomfort when you first start breastfeeding. This will often pass after a while. Sometimes treatment is needed.

You can get help with breastfeeding. During the first week after giving birth, you can contact the maternity ward, also called the BB ward.

You can also contact the children's health centre (BVC) or a midwifery clinic. Some places have special lactation support clinics.

Your breasts are taut and leaky

It is common for breasts to be taut or leaky, especially when your milk first comes in.
You may also produce more milk than your baby is able to take in.
Apply pressure to the nipple

You can apply pressure to the nipple to stop the flow of milk. There are also so-called milk catchers or nursing pads that you can put in your bra.

If you have too much milk, you can hand-express some milk before feeding your baby. Take a break once in a while and let the milk drain out on its own.
Engorgement

When your milk first comes in, your breasts may feel very firm and taut. This usually occurs three to four days after you have given birth. Your body temperature may also be higher than normal.

This is called engorgement, and it usually goes away after a few days.
How to find relief

The best way is to let your baby nurse often.

It may feel nice to put something warm or cold on your breasts.
Latching pain

It is common to feel sore when you first start breastfeeding. Your nipples are sensitive and not used to nursing yet. This usually passes.

It can also hurt if your baby has a shallow latch, meaning that they do not have their mouth open wide enough when nursing.
Here is a video showing how to help your baby get a deep latch.
Painkillers

You can use non-prescription medicines with paracetamol or ibuprofen if you are in pain.
Sore nipples

Blisters, sores or cracks can form on your nipples.
Important to keep clean and dry

Wash your hands before breastfeeding. It is important to keep the area clean if sores develop. You could develop an infection if bacteria get into the sores.

Avoid using soap and lotions on your breasts. You can massage breast milk into your nipples before and after nursing. You can also clean your breasts with saline solution.
Allow your nipples to rest

You may need to give your nipples a break from breastfeeding to let them heal. In such case, you can hand-express milk or use a breast pump.

You can also use an aid called a nipple shield, which is a flexible silicone teat that protects the nipple.
Thrush (yeast infection)

Cracked and sore nipples can also be caused by a yeast infection called thrush.

Thrush can clear up on its own. If not, you may need to use a special ointment.

It is also important to keep your breasts dry if you have thrush.
Breast abscess

There is a risk of developing a breast abscess if you have a breast infection. A breast abscess can be very painful. You may also have a fever.

A breast abscess needs to be treated by a doctor.
Blocked milk ducts

If your breasts remain overly full for a length of time, one or more of the milk ducts in your breast may become blocked. When this happens, the milk cannot come out.

Common symptoms:

    You have a lump under your skin.
    An area of your breast feels warm and tender.
    You have a fever.
    It hurts when you breastfeed.

Try to get the milk out

It is best if your baby continues to suckle the affected breast. This will help the milk come out.

You can also try to hand-express milk or use a breast pump.

While breastfeeding, pumping or hand-expressing, massage your breast starting at the hard area and moving towards your nipple.
When and where should I seek medical care?

Call the 1177 helpline if you need advice on what to do. Your call will be answered by a nurse. The nurse can speak both Swedish and English. Help is sometimes available in other languages. Call +46 771 11 77 00 if you are calling from a phone with a foreign number.
Seek medical care

Contact a healthcare centre if any of the following applies:

    it feels like you have an abscess in your breast
    you suspect you have a thrust (yeast) infection in your breast.

Sometimes a video call with a doctor or midwife is enough to provide the help you need.
Get help from an interpreter

You can get help from an interpreter if you do not speak Swedish.

Infant formula and follow-on formula
Bröstmjölksersättning och tillskottsnäring - engelska

Babies who do not receive breast milk need to be given infant formula. This is made to resemble breast milk. When the baby starts to eat regular food, they can be given what is known as follow-on formula instead.

How to feed a baby with a bottle

Some babies are given both breast milk and infant formula. Others are only given infant formula.

Läs texten på svenska här.
Infant formula

Infant formula contains everything a baby needs during the first six months of life. It resembles breast milk as closely as possible. However, it does not provide the same protection against infection as breast milk.

Infant formula is also called baby formula, infant milk, false milk or just formula.
Follow-on formula

Follow-on formula is designed as nutrition for an infant over six months of age. It can be given to a baby who has started on solid foods. Follow-on formula is not intended to be the baby’s sole source of nutrition.

If you would prefer to continue with infant formula, that is also fine. In such case, your baby may need a little extra iron.
Use only approved formula

Babies should be given formula that is made for their age. You can buy infant formula and follow-on formula in grocery stores or pharmacies.

Use only formula that is approved in Sweden.

Formula is available as a powder that you mix with water. Premixed formula is also available.
Teats and baby bottles

The most common way to give a baby infant formula is in a bottle. There are many different models of teats and baby bottles.

Try out different types to find a model that suits your baby.

Here are some tips about bottles and teats to keep in mind:

    Choose a bottle that holds at least 250 millilitres.
    Make sure there are no cracks in the teat.
    Replace the bottle if it is scratched.

    Choose a teat that is the right size for your baby’s age.

How to mix formula

It is important to maintain good hygiene when mixing formula.

Important things to keep in mind:

    Wash your hands first. Make sure everything around you is clean.

    Check that the bottles and teats are clean.
    Use cold water from the tap. If your water comes from a private well, you should first check the quality of the water.
    Follow the dosage listed on the package. Do not use too much or too little powder.
    The formula should be lukewarm. Test the temperature by putting a couple of drops on your wrist.
    Avoid heating the formula in the microwave.
    Mix new infant formula or follow-on formula for each meal. Do not save mixed formula for more than one hour.

How to feed your baby

How to bottle feed your baby:

    Hold the baby close to your body. Preferably skin-to-skin.
    Rub the teat against your baby’s mouth. When your baby turns toward the teat and opens their mouth, you can insert the teat into it.

    Angle the bottle so that the entire teat fills with formula. Otherwise, your baby could swallow air.
    Hold the bottle still and let your baby set the pace. Take breaks if your baby needs to.
    Allow the baby to suckle until they release the teat.

How to clean the bottle and teat

Wash the bottle and teat in hot water with dishwashing liquid.

You can wash the bottle in a dishwasher, but preferably not the teat.
If you need advice and support

It may take some time before bottle feeding works smoothly, and you may need to be patient. If you have any questions or need help, you can contact a children’s health centre (BVC). In the first week after the baby is born, you can contact the BB ward (maternity ward).

How to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
Så minskar du risken för plötslig spädbarnsdöd - engelska

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is when a baby stops breathing and dies, usually during sleep. It is very rare. The best way to reduce the risk is for the baby to sleep on their back.

It is common for babies to take small pauses in their breathing.

Sometimes, it can be a pause of several seconds.

This is perfectly natural and does not lead to sudden infant death syndrome.

Läs texten på svenska här.
What is SIDS?

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is when a baby stops breathing and dies unexpectedly. It is most common when the baby is asleep.

The baby usually does not show any signs of feeling unwell beforehand.

SIDS usually happens before the baby is six months old.
It is very rare

In Sweden, it is very rare for babies to die from SIDS.

It is not entirely clear what causes SIDS.

But there are some things you can do to reduce the risk. You can read about these below.
Let your baby sleep on their back

The most important piece of advice is that your baby should sleep on their back. This may help because it is easier to get air.

The baby should not sleep on their stomach.

It is not safe for the baby to sleep on their side, as they could roll over onto their stomach.
When the baby is able to roll over onto their side or stomach

The risk of SIDS decreases as the baby gets older.

The risk of SIDS is lower when the baby is able to roll over in their sleep.
Do not smoke

Nicotine and smoking are harmful to the baby. They also increase the risk of SIDS.
This is true both when you are pregnant and after the baby is born.

Nicotine can be found in products such as cigarettes, hookah, e-cigarettes and snus, which you put under your lip.

If you are breastfeeding, the nicotine is passed on to the baby.
Try to stop smoking

It is a good idea for everyone around your baby to try to stop smoking. Reduce smoking as much as possible if you cannot quit completely.

Contact a healthcare centre (vårdcentral) or a children's health centre (barnavårdscentral) if you would like help to stop smoking.
Make sure nothing is near your baby's face

If your baby's face is covered with something, it will be harder for them to breathe. Make sure there are no blankets, pillows, stuffed animals or other objects near your baby's face.

It is also a good idea to make sure your baby is not too warm.

Your baby needs to be able to move around while sleeping.
The safest place for a baby to sleep is in their own bed

Children under the age of three months sleep safest in their own bed in the same room as you.

If you sleep in the same bed, an arm or bedding could end up covering the baby's face.

It is also easier for the baby to end up on their side or stomach.
Move the baby over to their own bed

Your baby can be with you while you breastfeed or bottle-feed. Then place the baby on their back in their own bed.

If your baby falls asleep somewhere else, you can move them over to their own bed.
Do not drink alcohol

Your baby will be affected if you drink alcohol or use sedatives.

Here are some things that could happen:

    You will find it harder to wake up if your baby needs you.
    You might not notice if your baby is not getting air.
    You might accidentally lie on top of your baby.
    Your baby may end up on their stomach or their side.
